## push-swap. 

## The goal of this project:

to sort a list of numbers using two stacks. 

## Here are the only availible actions you can do with numbers in theese stacks:

1:  RA, RB, RR - reverse a stack by pushing every element to the bottom of the stack A, B or them both at the same time 

2:  SA, SB, SS - swap the two numbers on the top of the stack A, B or both of them at the same time 

3:  RRA, RRB, RRR - same actions like in RR-like commands but in the other direction 

4:  PA, PB - push the top stack value to another stack

## How to launch:

Run ```Make```

Than write ```./push_swap *numbers``` and input as many numbers as you want. 
Numbers can't repeat
