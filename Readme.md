This is one of many 42 school projects called "push-swap"\n
The goal of this project is to sort a list of numbers using two stacks.
Here are the only availible actions you can do with numbers in theese stacks:
1:  RA, RB, RR - reverse a stack by pushing every element to the bottom of the stack A, B or them both at the same time
2:  SA, SB, SS - swap the two numbers on the top of the stack A, B or both of them at the same time
3:  RRA, RRB, RRR - same actions like in RR-like commands but in the other direction
4:  PA, PB - push the top stack value to another stack
