parser:
if input ./push_swap "1, 2, 3, 4" 
- argc = 2
if input ./push_swap 1 2 4 5 8
- argc = 6
To check if no duplicates - create 2 while loop and compare elements
Also check for MAX_INT and MIN_INT


sorting - on a base of quicksort
we use bubble sort on small chunks of numbers to find their indexes
